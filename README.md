# Pep Talk Generator

A `PowerShell` script to help you either boost the morale of your team, or put you in the fasttrack to an HR complaint.

### How to use
1. Run the script `peptalk_gen.ps1`
2. Read the output in your terminal
3. Ask yourself if this is the type of praise becoming of one in your position to give to another
   - If `Yes`, forward the praise to another whose favor you are hoping to gain
   - If `No`, return to `Step 1`
